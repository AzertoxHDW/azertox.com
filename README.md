# Personnal website

This repo holds the reworked version of my personnal website (original version can be found here: https://github.com/AzertoxHDW/personnal-website).

## What it is:
A small website used to show some informations about me, what I do, what I'm working on and show my infrastructure, amongs other things.

## How it's created:
Thanks to [MathDesigns](https://github.com/MathDesigns), this version uses **Svelte**, in addition to **TailwindCSS**, to create a way better and visually attractive experience.

## The point behind this project:
The goal was to try new things, being from a programming standpoint (i.e. **Svelte**, that I've never tried before) or crazy ideas (like interractive rack diagrams, dynamic API communication between the website and some of my hosted services, or beyond realistic themes, for exemple). All of this with the help of [MathDesigns](https://github.com/MathDesigns) and some AI tools.

There is no point other than having fun creating something crazy overkill and thinkering around, even if it's kinda uselss in the end.
